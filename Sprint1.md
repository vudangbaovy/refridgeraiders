<h1>Sprint 1 Documentation</h1>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>1. As a home cook, I want to have a search bar that allows multiple keywords and filtering so that I can look up recipes based on some main ingredients I have in mind for a particular meal.</p>
<p>2. As a highly allergic person, I want to be able to filter out ingredients that cannot be in the recipes that I consume</p>
<p>3. Instead of always opening the site as a guest, I would like for this site to have a login page in order for all my data to be saved and personalized.</p>
<p>4. As a frequent user of the site, I want to be able to leave notes/comments about recipes that I've tried before so I know if I'd like to make any changes/adjustments to the given recipe incase I want it again.</p>
<h3>Issues to address</h3>
<p>1. Create a front-end with a search bar</p>
<p>2. Include a login page </p>
<p>3. The backend should be able to store basic user data such as: user names, passwords, and allergies. (Completed) </p>
<p>Successfully Completed Issues</p>
<p>We accomplished most of our goals for this sprint.</p>
<p> We were able to successfully create a database that stores usernames, passwords, admin level and allergies. However, we have not stored the favorited recipes yet as we have not come to a consensus on how to properly keep track of them. 
<p>We successfully completed the basis for the outline of what we would like the homepage of our website to look like. We implemented a very basic search bar</p>
<p>Uncompleted Issues</p>
<p>We did not complete the search bar that would allow for the written items to be saved and tagged. This would require type script code that we have yet to begin. We realized we had a lot of html and css to touch on and learn before we begin our type script code. Making a search bar with tagged items would require storing each item when the search button is clicked through a function made in the type script file.</p>
